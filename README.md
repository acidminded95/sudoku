# sudoku
In this repository I'm developing a python app which generates sudoku puzzles of different difficulties, times the games, keeps a record of the best times and offers the possibility to customize the colors of the GUI. For this I'm using object oriented programming and traceback functions, as well as the python Tkinter library to develop the GUI.
